# HDInsight Migration Workshop

This workshop contains two sets of lab exercises:

1. [Migrate a Cloudera cluster to HDInsight](Cloudera%20Migration/README.md)

1. [Migrate a MapR cluster to HDInsight](MapR%20Migration/README.md)


Both labs are very similar; they only vary in the technology used as the starting point for the migration. Select the lab most appropriate to your requirements.

**IMPORTANT:**

This lab creates several HDInsight clusters and a virtual machine for running Cloudera or MapR. Make sure that you delete these resources when you have finished, otherwise you will generate considerable charges.

Additionally, an HDInsight cluster comprises a number of virtual machines. You may need to request an increase in the quota for the number of CPU cores for your subscription before starting this lab. For more information, read [Requesting quota increases for Azure HDInsight](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/quota-increase-request).
