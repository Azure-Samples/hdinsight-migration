# Exercise 1: Migrate a Kafka workload to HDInsight

## Introduction

In this exercise, you'll migrate a Kafka workload from MapR to HDInsight. You'll perform the following tasks:

- Examine the existing Kafka workload running on MapR, including the Kafka producer and consumer applications.
- Create the virtual infrastructure for an HDInsight Kafka cluster, and then create the cluster.
- Configure MirrorMaker to replicate topics on the MapR cluster to the HDInsight cluster.
- Reconfigure the Kafka consumer application to receive messages from Kafka running on the HDInsight cluster.
- Reconfigure the Kafka producer application to post messages to Kafka running on the HDInsight cluster.

At the end of this process, all incoming data will be received and processed through the Kafka cluster on HDInsight, and the corresponding functionality in the MapR cluster can be retired.

## Task 1: Run the existing Kafka workload

The existing Kafka workload receives incoming data about airports, flights, delays, and other tracking information from a variety of sources. The Kafka producer application posts this data to Kafka topics as messages. The Kafka consumer retrieves these messages and processes them so that the data can be analyzed. 

---

**NOTE:**
In the *live* MapR system the consumer is a Spark application, but for the purposes of this exercise, you'll run a Scala application that simply retrieves and displays the messages from the Kafka topics. Additionally, in this exercise, the Kafka producer simulates receiving data by reading it from a CSV file.

---

![The structure of the existing Kafka system running on MapR](../Images/1-KafkaSystem.png)

1. On your desktop, open a **Command Prompt** window and sign in to the MapR virtual machine. Sign in as **azureuser** with the password you specified when you set up the MapR virtual machine. Replace *\<ip_address`>* with the IP address of the virtual machine.

    ```PowerShell
    ssh azureuser@<ip address>
    ```

1. Create a new Kafka topic named **flights**. The producer capturing the flight data will post messages to this topic. This is only a single node cluster, so set the **replication-factor** to 1. Also, set the number of partitions to 1, to minimize resource utilization for this constrained environment:

    ```bash
    kafka-topics.sh --create \
      --zookeeper onprem:5181 \
      --replication-factor 1 \
      --partitions 1 \
      --topic flights
    ```

1. Move to the **apps/kafka** folder: 

    ```bash
    cd ~/apps/kafka
    ```

    This folder contains two applications:

    1. **Producer.jar**, that simulates incoming data from flights and airports (this application reads data from a CSV file rather than receiving events). This app writes messages to the **flights** topic.

    1. **Consumer.jar**, which subscribes to the **flights** topic and displays the contents of the messages it reads.

1. Start the Producer app:

    ```bash
    java -cp EventProducer.jar eventdriver \
      --bootstrap-servers onprem:9092 \
      --sourcefilename 2000.csv \
      --topic flights \
      --partitions 1 > /dev/null &
    ```

    This command runs the Producer app silently in the background. You will receive a warning about the log4j configuration which you can safely ignore.

1. Start the consumer app:

    ```bash
    java -cp Consumer.jar eventconsumer \
      --bootstrap-servers onprem:9092 \
      --topic flights
    ```

    You should see messages similar to the following start to appear. These are the messages posted by the Producer app:

    ```text
    Offset = 352
    Value  = {"eventData":{"timestamp":1604244845680,"dateinfo":{"year":"\"2000\"","month":"\"1\"","dayofmonth":"\"24\"","dayofweek":"\"1\"","deptime":"\"2000\"","crsdeptime":"\"2000\"","arrtime":"\"2000\"","crsarrtime":"\"2000\""},"flightinfo":{"carrier":"\"2000\"","flightnum":"\"2000\"","tailnum":"\"2000\"","elapsedtime":"\"2000\"","crselapsedtime":"\"2000\"","airtime":"\"2000\"","arrdelay":"\"2000\"","depdelay":"\"2000\"","origin":"\"2000\"","dest":"\"2000\"","distance":"\"2000\""},"delayinfo":{"taxiin":"\"2000\"","taxiout":"\"2000\"","cancelled":"\"2000\"","cancellationcode":"\"2000\"","diverted":"\"2000\"","carrierdelay":"\"2000\"","weatherdelay":"\"2000\"","nasdelay":"\"2000\"","securitydelay":"\"2000\"","lateaircraftdelay":"\"2000\""}}}

    Offset = 354
    Value  = {"eventData":{"timestamp":1604244846681,"dateinfo":{"year":"\"2000\"","month":"\"1\"","dayofmonth":"\"5\"","dayofweek":"\"3\"","deptime":"\"2000\"","crsdeptime":"\"2000\"","arrtime":"\"2000\"","crsarrtime":"\"2000\""},"flightinfo":{"carrier":"\"2000\"","flightnum":"\"2000\"","tailnum":"\"2000\"","elapsedtime":"\"2000\"","crselapsedtime":"\"2000\"","airtime":"\"2000\"","arrdelay":"\"2000\"","depdelay":"\"2000\"","origin":"\"2000\"","dest":"\"2000\"","distance":"\"2000\""},"delayinfo":{"taxiin":"\"2000\"","taxiout":"\"2000\"","cancelled":"\"2000\"","cancellationcode":"\"2000\"","diverted":"\"2000\"","carrierdelay":"\"2000\"","weatherdelay":"\"2000\"","nasdelay":"\"2000\"","securitydelay":"\"2000\"","lateaircraftdelay":"\"2000\""}}}
    ...
    ```

1. Press Ctrl-C to stop the Consumer app.

1. Type the following command to terminate the Producer app:

    ```bash
    kill %1
    ```

1. Leave this command prompt window open.

## Task 2: Create the HDInsight Kafka cluster

In this task, you'll create a new virtual network and subnet to host the cluster.  Then you'll create an Azure Data Lake Gen 2 storage account to be used as the cluster storage for the HDInsight Kafka cluster. Next, you'll add a user-assigned managed identity that HDInsight will use to access the cluster storage. Finally, you'll create the Kafka cluster using this virtual infrastructure.

    ![The **kafkacluster*9999*** page in the Azure portal. The user has selected **Ambari home**](../Images/1-Cluster-Overview.png)

1. Sign in to Ambari as **admin** with password **Pa55w.rdDemo** when prompted. The Ambari page should show that the cluster is running the Zookeeper and Kafka services (amongst others):

    ![The Ambari home page, showing the running services.](../Images/1-Ambari-Home.png)


1. In the left-hand pane, select the **Kafka** service. In the main pane, select **Configs**. In the **Filter** box, type **min.insync.replicas**. Change the value of **min.insync.replicas** to 1, and then select **Save**.

    ![The Kafa configuration page in Ambari. The user has changed the **min.insync.replicas** setting to 1.](../Images/1-Configure-Kafka.png)

    ---

    **NOTE:** 
    
    This change is necessary due to the reduced number of nodes in the MapR cluster.

    ---

1. In the **Save Configuration** dialog box, select **Save** to confirm the change. Select **OK** when the updated has been made.

1. On the configuration page, select **Restart**, and then select **Restart All Affected** to restart the Kafka service with the new configuration. In the **Confirmation** dialog box, select **Confirm Restart All**.

1. In the **Background Operations** dialog, wait while the service restarts, and then select **OK**.

    ![The **Background Operations** page in Ambari. The Kafka service has restarted.](../Images/1-Restart-Kafka.png)

1. In the left-hand pane of the Ambari page, select **Hosts**. Make a note of the name prefixes and IP addresses of the worker nodes with the prefixes **wn0**, **wn1**, and **wn2**.

    ![The **Hosts** page in Ambari. The names and addresses of the worker nodes are highlighted.](../Images/1-Worker-Addresses.png)

1. Return to the **Command Prompt** window displaying the SSH connection to the MapR virtual machine.

1. Run the following command to create a bash shell running as root.

    ```bash
    sudo bash
    ```

1. Edit the **/etc/hosts** file, and add entries for each of the worker nodes in the HDInsight Kafka cluster to the end of the file. The file below shows an example:

    ---

    **NOTE:** 
    
    Use a text editor of your choice. Editors available for Ubuntu include **vi** and **nano**. The **vi** editor is intended for experienced users, but **nano** is more straightforward to use.

    ---

    ```text
    127.0.0.1 localhost

    # The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
    ::1 ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
    fe00::0 ip6-localnet
    ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
    ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
    ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
    ff02::3 ip6-allhosts

    10.1.0.4 onprem.internal.cloudapp.net onprem

    # Entries for worker nodes

    10.3.0.13 wn1-kafkac
    10.3.0.8  wn1-kafkac
    ```

1. Run the **ifconfig** command, and make a note of the **inet addr** field for the **eth0** device. This is the private IP address of the MapR virtual machine. The text below shows an example of the output generated by the **ifconfig** command. In this example, the **inet addr** is 10.1.0.4.

    ```text
    root@onprem:~/apps/kafka# ifconfig

            ...
    ```

1. Run the following command to quit the root shell and return to the azureuser shell.

    ```bash
    exit
    ```

1. In the Azure portal, on the page for **kafkacluster*9999***, under **Settings**, select **SSH + Cluster login**. In the **SSH + Cluster login** pane, in the **Hostname** list select your cluster, and then make a note of the **ssh** command you can use to connect to this cluster:

    ![The **kafkacluster*9999* | SSH + Cluster login** page in the Azure portal.](../Images/1-SSH-Cluster-Login.png)

1. On the desktop, open another command prompt window, and run the SSH command you just noted, to sign in to the head node of the Kafka cluster. The password is **Pa55w.rdDemo**:

    ```bash
    ssh sshuser@kafkacluster9999-ssh.azurehdinsight.net
    ```

1. Start a shell running as root:

    ```bash
    sudo bash
    ```

1. Edit the file **/etc/hosts**, and add an entry for the MapR virtual machine. The virtual machine has the name **onprem**, with the FQDN of **onprem.internal.cloudapp.net**. The file below shows an example, using the IP address 10.1.0.4 from the earlier step:

    ```text
    127.0.0.1 localhost

    # The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
    ::1 ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
    fe00::0 ip6-localnet
    ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
    ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
    ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
    ff02::3 ip6-allhosts
    10.3.0.20 hn0-kafkac.kaetua2hhycevkq3hkawfmrwjh.bx.internal.cloudapp.net  headnodehost hn0-kafkac.kaetua2hhycevkq3hkawfmrwjh.bx.internal.cloudapp.net. hn0-kafkac headnodehost. # SlaveNodeManager
    ...
    # MapR virtual machine
    10.1.0.4 onprem.internal.cloudapp.net onprem
    ```

1. Run the following command to quit the root shell and return to the sshuser shell.

    ```bash
    exit
    ```

1. Connect to the first worker node. The password is **Pa55w.rdDemo**, as before:

    ```bash
    ssh wn0-kafkac
    ```

1. Start a shell running as root, edit the **/etc/hosts** file, add the entry for the **onprem** virtual machine as before, and then exit the root shell.

1. Disconnect from the wn0-kafkac node, and return to the head node of the cluster.

1. Repeat the previous three steps for the two remaining worker nodes, **wn1-kafkac** and **wn1-kafkac**.

    ---

    **NOTE:**
    Under some circumstances, the worker nodes might not be named sequentially. For example, you might that they are named **wn3-kafkac** and **wn4-kafkac**. Check the entries in the **/etc/hosts** file of the head node for the names of these nodes.

    ---

### Configure MirrorMaker

1. As the **sshuser** on the head node in the Kafka cluster, use an editor to create a file named **consumer.properties**, with the following text:

    ```text
    bootstrap.servers=onprem:9092
    group.id=mirror-group
    auto.offset.reset=latest
    exclude.internal.topics=true
    ```

1. Create another file named **producer.properties** with the following text. Set the **boostrap.servers** property using the names of the worker nodes in your cluster:

    ```text
    bootstrap.servers=wn0-kafkac:9092,wn1-kafkac:9092,wn2-kafkac:9092
    acks=1
    batch.size=100
    ```

1. Run the following command to verify that the **flights** topic in the MapR cluster is accessible from the HDInsight Kafka cluster:

    ---

    **NOTE:**

    The path **/usr/hdp/4.1.2.5/kafka/bin/** for the Kafka utilities on the HDInsight cluster was correct at the time of writing, but may change as Microsoft update the implementation of Kafka. Check the contents of the **/usr/hdp** folder for any canges to the folder name for the Kafka utilities.

    ---

    ```bash
    /usr/hdp/4.1.2.5/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --list \
      --zookeeper onprem:5181
    ```

    The results should include the **flights** topic:

    ```text
    __consumer_offsets
    flights
    ```

1. Create a topic on the HDInsight Kafka cluster, also called **flights**:

    ---

    **NOTE:** 
    
    zk0-kafkac is the name of one of the Zookeeper nodes in the kafka cluster. The /etc/hosts file should already contain an entry for this node. It is possible that the Zookeeper nodes are numbered differently, in which case try zk1-kafkac.

    ---

    ```bash
    /usr/hdp/4.1.2.5/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create \
      --zookeeper zk0-kafkac:2181 \
      --replication-factor 3 \
      --partitions 1 \
      --topic flights
    ```

1. Verify that the local **flights** topic is also available:

    ```bash
    /usr/hdp/4.1.2.5/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --list \
      --zookeeper zk0-kafkac:2181
    ```

1. Start MirrorMaker as a background task:

    ```bash
    /usr/hdp/4.1.2.5/kafka/bin/kafka-mirror-maker.sh \
      --producer.config producer.properties \
      --consumer.config consumer.properties \
      --whitelist flights &
    ```

## Task 4: Reconfigure the Kafka consumer application

In this task, you'll migrate and reconfigure the Kafka consumer application to subscribe to topics in the HDInsight Kafka cluster.

![Kafka consumer subscribing to topics on the HDInsight cluster](../Images/1-HDInsightConsumer.png)

1. Switch back to the SSH session for the MapR virtual machine.

1. Move to the **apps/kafka** folder: 

    ```bash
    cd ~/apps/kafka
    ```

1. Start the Producer app in the background:

    ```bash
    java -cp EventProducer.jar eventdriver \
      --bootstrap-servers onprem:9092 \
      --sourcefilename 2000.csv \
      --topic flights \
      --partitions 1 > /dev/null &
    ```

1. Start the consumer app:

    ```bash
    java -cp Consumer.jar eventconsumer \
      --bootstrap-servers onprem:9092 \
      --topic flights
    ```

    You should see messages containing flight data, as before. Leave the app running.

    This application represents the existing client workload.

1. Open a new command prompt window on the desktop, and open another connection to the MapR virtual machine:

    ```bash
    ssh azureuser@<ip address>
    ```

1. Move to the **apps/kafka** folder: 

    ```bash
    cd ~/apps/kafka
    ```

1. Run the following command to copy the Consumer application to the head node on the HDInsight Kafka cluster. Replace ***9999*** with the number you used to identify your cluster:

    ```bash
    scp Consumer.jar sshuser@kafkacluster9999-ssh.azurehdinsight.net:~
    ```

1. Close this SSH session.

1. Switch back to the SSH session for the HDInsight Kafka cluster head node.

1. Start the consumer application, but connect it to the **flights** topic in the Kafka cluster:

    ```bash
    java -cp Consumer.jar eventconsumer \
      --bootstrap-servers wn0-kafkac:9092 \
      --topic flights
    ```

    Verify that messages start appearing. You have now migrated the Kafka client app to HDInsight.

1. Return to the SSH session for the MapR virtual machine, and press CTRL-C to stop the consumer application.

## Task 5: Reconfigure the Kafka producer application

In this task, you'll update the producer application to post messages to topics in the HDInsight cluster. After this step is complete, you can decommission Kafka in the MapR cluster.

![Kafka producer posting to topics on the HDInsight cluster](../Images/1-HDInsightProducer.png)

1. In the SSH session on the MapR virtual machine, run the following command to copy the Producer application to the head node in the HDInsight Kafka cluster:


    ```bash
    scp EventProducer.jar sshuser@kafkacluster9999-ssh.azurehdinsight.net:~
    ```

1. Copy the data file used as the events source to the HDInsight Kafka cluster:

    ```bash
    scp 2000.csv sshuser@kafkacluster9999-ssh.azurehdinsight.net:~
    ```

1. Open a new command prompt window on the desktop, and open another connection to the head node for the HDInsight Kafka cluster:

    ```bash
    ssh sshuser@kafkacluster9999-ssh.azurehdinsight.net
    ```

1. Start the **EventProducer** application and send messages to the **flights** topic in the Kafka cluster:

    ```bash
    java -cp EventProducer.jar eventdriver \
        --bootstrap-servers wn0-kafkac:9092 \
        --sourcefilename 2000.csv \
        --topic flights --partitions 1
    ```

1. Switch back to the SSH session for the MapR virtual machine.

1. Run the following command to stop the **EventProducer** application:

    ```bash
    kill %1
    ```

    ---

    **You have now migrated the Kafka applications to HDInsight and allowed the service to continue running while you did so.**

    ---

## Task 6: Tidy up

---

**NOTE:** 

Deleting the cluster doesn't delete the storage account or network resources. You can reuse these items for other clusters.

---

1. In SSH session running the **EventProducer** application, press CTRL-C to stop the application, and then run the following command to close the connection to the head node.

    ```bash
    exit
    ```

1. In SSH session running the **Consumer** application, press CTRL-C to stop the application, and then close the connection to the head node.

1. In the Azure portal, go to the page for the HDInsight Kafka cluster.

1. In the command bar, select **Delete**:

    ![The **kafkacluster*9999*** page in the Azure portal. The user is deleting the cluster](../Images/1-Delete-Cluster.png)

1. In the confirmation pane, enter the name of the cluster, and then select **Delete**.
